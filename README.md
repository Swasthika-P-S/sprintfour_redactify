# 🛡️ VEILiq – Intelligent Redaction Review System

> A full-stack application that detects, reviews, and corrects sensitive information (PII) before documents are shared with AI models.

PII Guardian solves the problem of security and privacy leakage by allowing users to scan text, visually review and audit detected entities (Indian Mobile Numbers, Emails, PAN Cards, Aadhaar Cards, IFSC, DOB, Names, and Addresses), customize redactions, and export secure text.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend**: React (JS), Axios, Vanilla CSS (custom design system)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Local instance)
- **AI/NER Service**: Google Gemini API (1.5 Flash) + Regex Pattern Matching Hybrid Pipeline

---

## Key Features

1. **Sage-Green Premium UI**: Clean, minimal, modern aesthetic using CSS variables, micro-animations, and responsive cards.
2. **Hybrid Detection Engine**: Combines the absolute precision of regexes (for standard formats like PAN, Aadhaar, Emails, Phone) with the semantic power of Google Gemini AI (for Names, Addresses, and Organizations).
3. **Interactive Review Panel**: Full control to **Accept**, **Reject**, or **Edit** the replacement token for every single flagged item.
4. **Ad-Hoc Custom PII Additions**: Select or type any missing information, choose its category, and add it immediately with one click.
5. **Real-Time Confidence Metrics**: Visual status bars showing detection confidence percentages.
6. **"Why was this detected?" Explanation**: Click on any detected item to see a clear, developer-friendly explanation of why the engine flagged it.
7. **Interactive Dashboard Statistics**: Real-time counter cards showing documents loaded, total items found, accepted, and rejected.
8. **Document History Database**: Full persistence in MongoDB to review previous redaction runs.
